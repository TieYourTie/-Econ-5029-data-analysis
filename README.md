## 📌 Research Question & Motivation  

### **❓ Research Question**  
> Do higher housing supply elasticities cause housing supply and, consequently, housing prices to respond more strongly to monetary policy changes?  

### **💡 Motivation**  
- There is strong precedence in the literature for analyzing housing supply using elasticities.  
- There is a lack of empirical work linking monetary policy and housing supply responses.  
- Understanding this relationship can help policymakers anticipate the effects of interest rate changes on housing markets.  

## 📊 Methodology  
- **Data Sources:**  
  - Macroeconomic and housing market data from sources such as the Federal Reserve, Bank of Canada, and housing market reports.  
- **Econometric Approach:**  
  - Panel data regression models with fixed effects to estimate the impact of monetary policy changes on housing supply and prices.  
- **Identification Strategy:**  
  - Monetary policy shocks are measured using central bank interest rate changes, and housing supply elasticity is used as an interaction term to assess differential responses.
